# Proyecto-Finanzas-Cuantitativas

This repository is for storing everything related to the
CIFI project, and for anyone interested in testing 
the project and learning more about the Heston model to
access it at their leisure.

If you want to run our graphical interface, you just need to navigate to the 'frontend' file from the terminal and execute the command 'streamlit run frontend.py'

We hope you can understand and try the Heston model in a good experience.
